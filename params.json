  "body": "# ardrone-webflight\r\n\r\nPilot the AR.Drone 2.0 directly from your browser. Extend the application with plugins\r\nto add features such as video recording, autonomous flight, face recognition, and more.\r\nIt makes it a very friendly environment to quickly build and experiment with your drone \r\n(e.g. during a nodecopter event).\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an issue; please submit it to the issue tracker! You can also catch\r\nup with me (eschnou) on twitter or on #freenode (channel #nodecopter).\r\n\r\n**This branch is the development branch, there are no packaged release yet.** \r\n\r\n## Built-in plugins\r\n\r\n* **[video-png](plugins/video-png/)** stream the video to the browser through static image loading, \r\n    works great in every browser.\r\n\r\n* **[video-stream](plugins/video-stream/)** use [node-dronestream](https://github.com/bkw/node-dronestream) to stream the raw h264 video \r\nfeed via webscokets and rendering in Javascript !!! Need a modern browser and CPU.\r\n\r\n* **[hud](plugins/hud/)** to visualize a head-up display with artificial horizon, compass, \r\n    altimeter, etc. Based on [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit)\r\n\r\n* **[pilot](plugins/pilot)** to control the drone remotely using the keyboard. Based on [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nWebFlight requires a recent nodejs (built and tested with node > 0.10) as well as\r\n[npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:eschnou/ardrone-webflight\r\ncd ardrone-webflight\r\nnpm install\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Copy the config.js.sample to config.js and edit to select your plugins\r\n2. Connect to the drone's wifi\r\n3. Run `node app.js`\r\n4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/\r\n\r\nIf you have enabled the **pilot** plugin, you can fly the drone with the following keys. Yes, \r\nthese are azerty bindings :-) If you need qwerty ones, just hack the plugin. I'll need to find \r\na way to provide custome configuration etc.\r\n\r\nUse `Z, S, Q, D` to move front, back and sideways. Use your `cursors` to go up/down or turn \r\nclockwise/counter clockwise. Use `t` to takeoff and `l` for landing.\r\n\r\n## Adding your own plugin\r\n\r\nThere is no tutorial yet, in the meanwhile, just have a look at the built in plugins, \r\nit is faily straightforward. \r\n\r\nI would like to maintain a list of user plugins. If you hack something, please let me know\r\nand I'll add you to the list.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThis work is based on the integration of [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit) \r\nand [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser), refactored in a plugin architecture.\r\n\r\nAlso a big thank you to [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge) for his [node-ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone) library \r\nwhich pushed me into buying a drone and become crazy about these little flying robots!\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 by the AUTHORS\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
